# WEB_DEVLOPMENT_PROJECT

The project objective is to book Movie tickets online. The Ticket Booking System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the Net and can be accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application will reserve the tickets. This online ticket reservation system provides a website for a cinema hall where any user of internet can access it. User is required to login to the system and book the tickets. Tickets can be collected at the counter and Watching movies with family and friends in theatres is one of the best medium of entertainment after having a hectic schedule. But all this excitement vanishes after standing in hours in long queues to get tickets booked. The website provides complete information regarding currently running movies on all the screens with details of show-timings, available seats. Ticket reservations are done using credit card and can be cancelled if needed. Our online tickets reservation system is one of the best opportunities for those who cannot afford enough time to get their tickets reserved standing in long queues. People can book tickets online at any time of day or night. Our reservation system also provides support and FAQ.
